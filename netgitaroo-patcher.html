=============
What is this?
=============

This is a mod to allow you to play VS mode over the internet.
It works on both emulator and actual console.

====================
Installation/Running
====================

You will need the following:
- An uncompressed .iso file of the North American PS2 Gitaroo Man.
- This webpage

In addition, you will need *one* of the following
- A PS2 emulator, running on a computer that is connected to the internet via Ethernet.
- A PS2 that you can run backups on that is connected via Ethernet to a network that has DHCP.

To patch your .iso file, simply click "Choose File" at the bottom of the page, select your
.iso file, and click "Create Patched File".

After that you can use the .iso file on a PS2 or a PS2 emulator.
Methods to run on a PS2 include:
- <a href='https://www.psx-place.com/threads/open-ps2-loader-0-9-3-user-guide-by-shaolinassassin.20541/'>OPL</a> over USB or HDD
- ESR (using Free McBoot, or other exploit)
- <a href='https://www.psx-place.com/threads/freedvdboot-by-cturt.30220/#post-255696'>FreeDvdBoot patcher (requires slim PS2)</a>

==============
Emulator notes
==============

I do not recommend playing this mod over emulator. However, if you do, I recommend the following:

- Ensure you are using the latest development build of PCSX2, one with built-in networking support.
- Under Audio Settings, make sure Synchronizing Mode is set to "Async Mix". This is to ensure the game doesn't go out of sync.
- Make sure Fast CDVD is disabled under speedhacks
- You will need <a href='https://nmap.org/npcap/'>NPCAP</a> installed to use PCSX2's networking functionality on Windows
- Under "Network and HDD Settings" make sure that Ethernet is enabled, your ethernet device is Ethernet, switched.
- You may need to use DHCP intercept, and configure a static IP using the options in the network and HDD settings menu.

=============
Using the mod
=============

Once you start up the game, if you enter the VS Mode menu, you will see three options, "Host", "Join", and "Couch".

Host will allow you to see your PS2's IP address, as well as allow others to connect to you. If the IP address displayed
is 0.0.0.0 that means that something is wrong. It could be that the DHCP failed, or another problem. In addition, you will
likely need to port forward port 13437. If you don't know what that is, google is your friend. The game uses UDP.

Join will allow you to join another's game. Use left and right on the D-pad to select digits of the IP adderess, use Up and Down
to increment and decrement the digits, and once you are done, press X to begin connecting. You can press Triangle to cancel connecting.

Couch will let you play the old way, with two controllers plugged in.

When the connection is established, the person hosting gets Player 1, and the person joining gets Player 2. Player 1 may switch places
by pressing square and circle at the same time.

Currently, there is no way for Player 2 to end the connection, besides unplugging the network cable.

==============
Other features
==============

If you have netcat installed (Linux distributions often come with netcat) you can connect to UDP port 22577 to receive debug messages
from the game. An example of how to run it is like so:

    netcat -u &lt;ip of ps2&gt; 22577

After running this, press Enter to send a blank UDP packet to the PS2 (so it knows that you exist), and it should start sending back
any debug messages.
